excerpt: A major problem in agriculture is plant disease that is not recognized in the early stages, due to which, the people working in this industry face resulting losses, such as lost income, loss of time and effort, etc. We have surveyed different hardware implementations of plant disease detection on embedded devices, such as the Raspberry Pi, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with very large scale integration (VLSI), and ARM processors that use frameworks such as TinyML and TFLite. And studied and analyzed major deep learning algorithms and techniques, such AlexNet, long short-term memory (LSTM), LeNet-5, and ResNet, which have been used for plant disease detection.
