excerpt: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases whose complete cure is not found to date. Therapies and medications are supportive methods to deal with symptoms. There is always a requirement of medical domain expertise to diagnose PD manually. Since manual diagnosis leads to a time-consuming process, an automatic technique has always been useful in such complex tasks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based computer-aided diagnosis helps medical experts to diagnose PD more precisely and fast. Texture-based radiomic analysis is carried out on 3D MRI scans of T1 weighted and resting-state modalities.Classification accuracies were obtained from 61.11% to 83.33% and area under the curve-receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) values range from 0.43 to 0.86 using four variants of LBP.
