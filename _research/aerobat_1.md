excerpt: This work focuses on stabilizing the flight dynamics of Northeatern's tailless bat-inspired micro aerial vehicle, Aerobat. Unlike traditional insect-style designs, Aerobat incorporates morphing wings and lacks a tail, making flight control more complex. To stabilize its position and orientation during hovering, we employ a guard design with small thrusters and combine it with a flapping system and a multi-rotor. We assume the guard cannot directly observe Aerobat's states and propose the use of an observer to estimate these states for closed-loop hovering control of the Guard-Aerobat platform.
