excerpt:  "The growth of medical sensors like heart rate,blood sugar, and other health monitoring sensors is huge.Along with the use of sensors in devices and healthcare systems, the use of image classification models like mask detection on edge devices is of growing demand. The survey consists of various techniques used in modern healthcare devices and various other methods like sensor fusion and wireless sensors to collect and monitor health data. And it also
includes a comparison of multiple mask detection models which were deployed on embedded devices like Raspberry Pi, Nvidia Jetson and cameras like OpenMV, ESP32Cam and deep learning models like MobileNetV1, InceptionV4, and YOLO Tiny which were optimized using TensorFlow Lite."
