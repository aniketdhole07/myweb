excerpt: Due to social distancing norms, several restrictions have been established in public settings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no automated systems or procedures for managing large groups of people in offices and schools. Some systems use camera footage of workspaces to verify whether individuals are wearing masks, and temperature checks are done manually by designated authorities and processed on massive servers. The paper contains a proposed prototype of a portable device that can manage if individuals entering the workspace are wearing masks, and have an appropriate heart pulse rate using M5Stack Core2, ESP32 Camera Module, and distance sensors. For optimization and fast Mask Detection Model which will run entirely on the device, Tensorflow Lite and Edge Computing are used. The mask detection model achieves an accuracy of 87.8%.
