excerpt: Nowadays, running computer vision models on embedded devices like Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson has become ubiquitous. But the main issue is the limited performance on these devices due to smaller CPUs and power factors. To solve this, we have proposed research on various parallel processing techniques to get complete optimal performance of computer vision models like GoogleNet, Squeezenet, and Mobilenet on a Raspberry Pi using OpenVino Toolkit. We tested and compared these models' interpretation on factors like CPU, RAM Utilization, and Inference Time using Two Neural Compute Sticks and analyzed it on different Intel Processors. The results using Two Neural Sticks were significant than typical processors and increased by a factor of 2 to 3 for all models. So using these results, we can directly use the technique for the suitable model.
